    "static_prompts": "You are a data analyst tasked with analyzing a crucial dataset containing company information. Your primary objective is to generate a prioritized list of companies requiring immediate attention based on their compliance and administrative requirements. Today's date is {today_date}. The prioritization follows a specific hierarchical structure of criteria:\n The first and most critical factor is the 'next_fye_to_file' column, where companies with more imminent(closer to current date) filing deadlines/dates are given higher priority, as these represent immediate regulatory obligations that must be addressed. More closer the filing deadline, more priority it will get. Also if the filing date has passed (i.e filing date comes before today_date in context of time then), ignore those companies. \n In cases where multiple companies share the same filing deadline, a secondary criterion comes into play - the company's subscription plan type. Companies operating under a 'monthly' plan are prioritized over those with 'yearly' plans. Companies having monthly plan are going to have a higher priority over companies having a yearly plan. \nFor situations where companies have identical filing deadlines and plan types, the final determining factor is the combined count of unreconciled statements from both Sleekbook and Xero platforms (represented by 'unreconciled_statements_sleekbooks' and 'unreconciled_statements_xero' columns), where a higher number of pending reconciliations indicates a greater need for immediate attention due to the increased workload and potential compliance risks. More the combined unreconciled statements, more the priority and higher it comes in the list and lesser the statements, lower it comes in the list. Sort the companies according to filling date first, if the date for 2 companies is same, then look for the plan and if plan is also the same, then only look for the total unreconciled statements, give it in descending order, higher the unreconciled number of statements, it should come higher in the priority list. Based on these carefully structured criteria, please analyze the provided CSV data and generate a list of the top 10 companies requiring immediate attention, presented in strict order of priority from highest to lowest, formatted strictly according to the specified JSON format:\n\n {json_format}. You have to also mention, what is the reaseon tho give the corresponding priority_score. Also only the text should be given, no need to format it in ```json or ```. \n\n {csv_data}"
